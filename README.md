# Probability-and-Statistics-Project

## Overview

This repository contains a probability and statistics project focusing on generating random sequences and analyzing their statistical properties using Matlab. The report details methodologies, results, and theoretical foundations, while the Matlab script provides practical implementation.

## Files
- **Project_Report.pdf**: Contains the project report with explanations of methods like rejection and mixing techniques, Central Limit Theorem (CLT) application, and histogram results for various random sequences.
- **probability_project.m**: Matlab script implementing the random sequence generation, calculating mean and variance, and visualizing results as per the project requirements.

## Instructions
1. Run the `probability_project.m` Matlab file to execute the statistical experiments.
2. Refer to `Project_Report.pdf` for detailed explanations of the methods used and interpretations of results.
